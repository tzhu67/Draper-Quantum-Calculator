# Draper-Quantum-Calculator
This is an initial submission for QC bootcamp project I. There was only one hour of work and need a lot of continuation and revisions to meet requirements.
1. Addition circuit is cited from Draper's paper, while multiplication is expected to be built upon multiple additions, using the fact that multiplying by 2^k is equivalent to shift k digits.
2. Missing verification with several examples.
3. Need to decompose swap and cp into U and cx.
4. The final version should be out-of-place.
5. Complexity analysis.
If it allows, I will try to update asap.
